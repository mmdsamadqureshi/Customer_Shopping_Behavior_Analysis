# End-to-End Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, covering data ingestion, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting. It is built to reflect **real-world data analyst responsibilities**, integrating Python, SQL (MySQL), and Power BI into a single analytics pipeline.

The goal is to show how raw data can be converted into **clear insights and business-ready outputs**.

---

## Dataset

* Format: CSV (structured tabular data)
* Data Type: Numerical and categorical variables
* Usage: Business-style exploratory and performance analysis

The dataset is first processed in Python, then stored and queried in MySQL, and finally visualized in Power BI.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis

  * Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
* **MySQL** – Data storage and SQL-based querying
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation
* **Gamma** – Report and presentation (PPT) creation
* **Git/GitHub** – Version control and documentation

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading (Python)

* Imported raw dataset into Python
* Reviewed schema, data types, and structure

### 2. Data Cleaning & EDA

* Handled missing values and duplicates
* Standardized and corrected data types
* Conducted EDA to identify:

  * Trends
  * Outliers
  * Key relationships

### 3. SQL Analysis (MySQL)

* Loaded cleaned data into MySQL server
* Created structured tables
* Wrote SQL queries for:

  * Aggregations
  * Filtering
  * Business-level metrics

### 4. Power BI Dashboard

* Connected Power BI directly to MySQL
* Built an interactive dashboard featuring:

  * KPIs
  * Trend analysis
  * Category-level insights
  * Filters and slicers for exploration

### 5. Reporting & Presentation

* Created a structured analytics report
* Designed a professional presentation (PPT) using Gamma
* Focused on insights, findings, and recommendations for stakeholders
